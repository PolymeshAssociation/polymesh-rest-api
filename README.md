```

### Signing Transactions

There are currently two [signing managers](https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/signing-managers#projects) the REST API can be configured with, the local signer or the [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) signer. If args for both are given, Vault takes precedence

For any method that modifies chain state, the key to sign with can be controlled with the "signer" field.

1. Local Signing:
   By using `LOCAL_SIGNERS` and `LOCAL_MNEMONICS` private keys will be initialized in memory. When making a transaction that requires a signer use the corresponding `LOCAL_SIGNERS` (by array offset).
1. Vault Signing:
   By setting `VAULT_URL` and `VAULT_SECRET`an external [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) instance will be used to sign transactions. The URL should point to a transit engine in Vault that has Ed25519 keys in it. To refer to a key when signing use the Vault name and version `${name}-${version}` e.g. `alice-1`.

### Authentication

The REST API uses [passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/) for authentication. This allows the service to be configurable with multiple strategies.

Currently there are two strategies available:

1. Api Key:
   By configuring `apiKey` as a strategy, any request with the header `x-api-key` will be authenticated with this strategy. The env `API_KEYS` can be used to provide initial keys.
1. Open:
   By configuring `open` as a strategy any request will be authenticated with a default user. This is primarily intended for development, however it can be used to provide a "read only" API. It should **never** be used in combination with a signing manager that holds valuable keys.

More strategies can be added, there are many [pre-made strategies](https://www.passportjs.org/packages/) that are available, and custom ones can be written.

To implement a new strategy, create a new file in `~/auth/strategies/` and update the `strategies.consts` file with an appropriate name. Be sure to add some tests for your logic as well.

### State

The REST API has taken a plugin style approach to where it stores state. Do note, the Polymesh chain is responsible for processing most POST request. This only affects where REST API specific entities are stored (e.g. Users and ApiKeys). Most transactions are permanently stored on chain regardless of the datastore used

Currently there are two datastore available:

1. LocalStore:
   This is the default setting. This uses the process memory to store state. This allows the REST API to be ran as a single process which is convenient for development purposes, or when an instance is intended for read only purposes (i.e. no `signers` are loaded). However all state will be lost when the process shuts down
1. Postgres
   This is the more production ready approach. This allows state to be persisted, and multiple server instances to user the same information. Internally this uses TypeORM to manage the database

`package.json` contains scripts to help manage the development postgres service defined in `docker-compose.yml`. These are all prefixed with `postgres:dev`, e.g. `yarn postgres:dev:start`, which will use the configuration defined in `postgres.dev.config`.

To implement a new repo for a service, first define an abstract class describing the desired interface. Also write a test suite to specify the expected behavior from an implementation. Then in the concrete implementations define a new Repo that satisfies the test suite.

To implement a new datastore create a new module in `~/datastores` and create a set of `Repos` that will implement the abstract classes. You will then need to set up the `DatastoreModule` to export the module when it is configured. For testing, each implemented Repo should be able to pass the `test` method defined on the abstract class it is implementing.

### Webhooks (alpha)

Normally the endpoints that create transactions wait for block finalization before returning a response, which normally takes around 15 seconds. Alternatively `webhookUrl` can be given in any state modifying endpoint. When given, the server will respond after submitting the transaction to the mempool with 202 (Accepted) status code instead of the usual 201 (Created).

Before sending any information to the endpoint the service will first make a request with the header `x-hook-secret` set to a value. The endpoint should return a `200` response with this header copied into the response headers.

If you are a developer you can toggle an endpoint to aid with testing by setting the env `DEVELOPER_UTILS=true` which will enabled a endpoint at `/developer-testing/webhook` which can then be supplied as the `webhookUrl`. Note, the IsUrl validator doesn't recognize `localhost` as a valid URL, either use the IP `127.0.0.1` or create an entry in `/etc/hosts` like `127.0.0.1 rest.local` and use that instead.

#### Warning

Webhooks are still being developed and should not be used against mainnet. However the API should be stable to develop against for testing and demo purposes

Webhooks have yet to implement a Repo. As such the subscription status is not persisted and the service can not guarantee delivery in the face of ordinary compting faults.

In its current state the transactions would have to be reconciled with chain events as there is a chance for notifications to not be delivered.

### With docker

To pass in the env variables you can use `-e` to pass them individually, or use a file with `--env-file`.
For documentation you will need to expose a port that maps to `:3000` (or its `$PORT` if set) in the container.

```bash
docker build . -t $image_name
docker run -it --env-file .pme.env -p $HOST_PORT:3000 $image_name
```

Accessing `http://localhost:<PORT>` will take you to the swagger playground UI where all endpoints are documented and can be tested
